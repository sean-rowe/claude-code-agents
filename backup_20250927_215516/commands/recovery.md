Perform complete project recovery to get everything working:

1. IDENTIFY all issues:
   - Compilation errors
   - Test failures
   - Missing dependencies
   - Configuration problems
   - Placeholder code

2. PRIORITIZE by severity:
   - Build-breaking errors first
   - Compilation warnings
   - Failing tests
   - Code quality issues

3. FIX systematically:
   - Resolve compilation errors
   - Fix all warnings
   - Make all tests pass
   - Remove placeholder code
   - Fix security issues

4. VALIDATE the recovery:
   - Full build succeeds
   - All tests pass
   - No warnings
   - No placeholder code
   - Security scan clean

Continue until the project is fully functional.
Do not stop at "good enough" - achieve complete recovery.
