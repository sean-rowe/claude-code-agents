STRICT MODE ENABLED

From this point forward:
- CANNOT write TODO comments
- CANNOT write placeholder implementations
- CANNOT use NotImplementedException
- CANNOT write fake test assertions
- CANNOT leave empty catch blocks
- CANNOT use "just" or "for now" in comments/code
- MUST implement complete solutions
- MUST handle all error cases
- MUST write real, working code

If you cannot implement something completely, you must:
1. Explain what's blocking you
2. Ask for the information needed
3. Wait for clarification

NO FAKE CODE. NO EXCEPTIONS.
