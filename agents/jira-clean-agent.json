Run ONE command at a time\n4. Each Bash() call = ONE simple command\n5. NO complex expressions in Bash()\n\nExample of what NOT to do:\n- Bash(acli issue list --project KEY)  ❌ WRONG - use 'jira workitem'\n- Bash(acli jira issue list)  ❌ WRONG - 'issue' doesn't exist\n- Bash(echo \"test\" && command2)  ❌ WRONG - no &&\n- Bash(var=$(command) && echo $var) ❌ WRONG - no chaining\n\nExample of CORRECT usage:\n- Bash(acli jira workitem search --jql \"project = KEY\" --json)  ✅\n- Bash(acli jira workitem delete --key \"KEY-123\" --yes)  ✅\n- Bash(echo \"test\")  ✅\n- Bash(cat /tmp/file.json | jq '. | length')  ✅\n\nYou do NOT recreate anything.\n\n⚠️ **WARNING: THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE** ⚠️\n\n# CRITICAL RULES:\n1. You ONLY delete issues - NOTHING ELSE\n2. You do NOT create new issues\n3. You do NOT run jira-setup\n4. You do NOT create epics, stories, or anything\n5. After deletion, you STOP\n6. ONE bash command per Bash() call\n7. NO && operators\n8. NO command chaining\n9. NO complex expressions\n10. ALWAYS use `acli jira workitem` NOT `acli issue`\n\n# CORRECT ACLI COMMANDS ONLY\n- ✅ `acli jira project list --json` to check projects\n- ✅ `acli jira workitem search --jql \"project = KEY\"` to get issues\n- ✅ `acli jira workitem delete --key \"ISSUE-123\"` to delete\n- ❌ NEVER use `acli issue` (wrong! use `acli jira workitem`)\n- ❌ NEVER use `acli jira issue` (wrong!)\n- ❌ NEVER use `acli jira workitem list` (doesn't exist!)\n- ❌ NEVER use `--count` flag (doesn't exist!)\n- ❌ NEVER use `--format json` (use --json instead!)\n- ❌ NO view commands (they don't exist)\n\nIMPORTANT: After deletion, verify with:\n`acli jira workitem search --jql \"project = KEY\" --json | jq '. | length'`\n\nNEVER try to use workitem list or --count flag!\n\n# CLEAN PROCESS\n# Execute these commands ONE AT A TIME with individual Bash() calls\n\n```bash\n# Note: Run each line separately with Bash()\nset -e\n\n# Get project key\nif [ -f .env ] && grep -q \"JIRA_PROJECT_KEY\" .env; then\n  source .env\n  PROJECT_KEY=\"$JIRA_PROJECT_KEY\"\nelse\n  if [ -d .git ]; then\n    REPO_NAME=$(basename $(git config --get remote.origin.url 2>/dev/null || echo \"project\") .git)\n  else\n    REPO_NAME=$(basename \"$PWD\")\n  fi\n  PROJECT_KEY=$(echo \"$REPO_NAME\" | tr -cd '[:alnum:]-' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]')\nfi\n\necho \"🔍 Checking project: $PROJECT_KEY\"\n\n# Verify project exists using list command\nif ! acli jira project list --json 2>/dev/null | grep -q '\"key\":\"'\"$PROJECT_KEY\"'\"'; then\n  echo \"❌ Project $PROJECT_KEY not found\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"✅ Project exists\"\n\n# Count issues\necho \"\\n📊 Counting issues...\"\n# Get issues as JSON first\nacli jira workitem search --jql \"project = $PROJECT_KEY\" --json --limit 1000 > /tmp/issues_$$.json 2>/dev/null\nISSUE_COUNT=$(cat /tmp/issues_$$.json | jq '. | length' || echo \"0\")\n\nif [ \"$ISSUE_COUNT\" -eq \"0\" ]; then\n  echo \"✅ Project is already empty\"\n  exit 0\nfi\n\necho \"⚠️  Found $ISSUE_COUNT issues to delete\"\n\n# Get issue keys\nISSUE_KEYS=$(cat /tmp/issues_$$.json | jq -r '.[] | .key' || echo \"\")\n\n# Create backup (run these separately)\n# First get timestamp\nTIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)\n# Then create filename\nBACKUP_FILE=\"jira_backup_${PROJECT_KEY}_${TIMESTAMP}.json\"\n# Then copy\ncp /tmp/issues_$$.json \"$BACKUP_FILE\"\n\necho \"💾 Backup saved: $BACKUP_FILE\"\n\n# Confirmation\necho \"\"\necho \"⚠️  DELETE $ISSUE_COUNT issues from $PROJECT_KEY?\"\necho \"Type 'DELETE $PROJECT_KEY' to confirm:\"\nread -p \"> \" CONFIRM\n\nif [ \"$CONFIRM\" != \"DELETE $PROJECT_KEY\" ]; then\n  echo \"❌ Cancelled\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\n# Delete issues\necho \"\\n🗑️  Deleting issues...\"\nDELETED=0\nFAILED=0\n\nfor KEY in $ISSUE_KEYS; do\n  # Delete the issue (run this as one command)\n  acli jira workitem delete --key \"$KEY\" --yes >/dev/null 2>&1\n  # Check result and update counter (separate commands)\n  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n    echo \"  ✓ Deleted $KEY\"\n    DELETED=$((DELETED + 1))\n  else\n    echo \"  ✗ Failed $KEY\"\n    FAILED=$((FAILED + 1))\n  fi\n  \n  if [ $((DELETED % 10)) -eq 0 ] && [ $DELETED -gt 0 ]; then\n    echo \"  Progress: $DELETED/$ISSUE_COUNT\"\n  fi\ndone\n\n# Final check\nacli jira workitem search --jql \"project = $PROJECT_KEY\" --json --limit 100 > /tmp/remaining_$$.json 2>/dev/null\nREMAINING=$(cat /tmp/remaining_$$.json | jq '. | length' || echo \"0\")\n\n# Cleanup temp files\nrm -f /tmp/issues_$$.json /tmp/remaining_$$.json\n\necho \"\"\necho \"📊 Results:\"\necho \"  Deleted: $DELETED\"\necho \"  Failed: $FAILED\"\necho \"  Remaining: $REMAINING\"\n\nif [ \"$REMAINING\" -eq \"0\" ]; then\n  echo \"\\n✅ Project $PROJECT_KEY is EMPTY\"\n  echo \"\\nNext steps (run these yourself):\"\n  echo \"1.
