Automatically fix ALL issues found during code audit with zero manual intervention.

## WORKFLOW:

### PHASE 1: PROJECT DETECTION, AUDIT & PLAN CREATION
1. DETECT PROJECT TYPE:
   ```bash
   if [ -f "package.json" ]; then PROJECT_TYPE="TypeScript/JavaScript"
   elif [ -f "CMakeLists.txt" ] || ls *.cpp 2>/dev/null; then PROJECT_TYPE="C++"
   elif [ -f "requirements.txt" ] || ls *.py 2>/dev/null; then PROJECT_TYPE="Python"
   elif [ -f "go.mod" ]; then PROJECT_TYPE="Go"
   elif ls *.cs 2>/dev/null; then PROJECT_TYPE="C#"
   ```

2. Run TARGETED /auditFake scan based on project type:
   - C++ Project: Focus 80% on void*, C-casts, new/delete, malloc, #define
   - TypeScript: Focus 80% on 'any' types, missing annotations, || vs ??
   - Python: Focus 80% on missing type hints, bare except:
   - Universal: TODO/FIXME, "just", "for now", debug prints (20% effort)

3. Parse and categorize ALL issues found
3. **CREATE AND DISPLAY A CONCRETE PLAN:**

```markdown
## üéØ ACTION PLAN - [Project: C++/TypeScript/Python] - [X Total Issues]

### üî¥ PROJECT-SPECIFIC CRITICAL (80% of effort here)
[Show issues most relevant to detected project type first]

[IF C++ PROJECT:]
- [ ] **src/buffer.cpp:45** - void* data ‚Üí Use std::vector<uint8_t>
- [ ] **src/memory.cpp:12** - malloc(size) ‚Üí Use std::make_unique
- [ ] **src/parser.cpp:89** - (int*)ptr ‚Üí Use static_cast<int*>

[IF TYPESCRIPT PROJECT:]
- [ ] **src/api.ts:89** - Type 'any' for userInput ‚Üí Create UserInput interface
- [ ] **src/auth.ts:45** - Missing return type ‚Üí Add : Promise<AuthResult>
- [ ] **src/utils.ts:23** - value || default ‚Üí Use value ?? default

### üü† HIGH - Functionality Issues
- [ ] **src/payment.js:67** - TODO: Add retry logic ‚Üí Implement 3 retries with exponential backoff
- [ ] **tests/user.test.js:34** - Assert.Pass() ‚Üí Test actual user creation

### üü° MEDIUM - Code Quality Issues
- [ ] **src/models/product.js:23** - Generic Object type ‚Üí Define ProductSchema interface
- [ ] **tests/api.test.js:45** - test('api works') ‚Üí Convert to BDD it('should return 200 when...')
- [ ] **src/config.js:12** - Magic number 3000 ‚Üí const DEFAULT_PORT = 3000
- [ ] **src/retry.js:45** - if (attempts > 5) ‚Üí const MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 5
- [ ] **src/user.js:89** - if (role === 'admin') ‚Üí enum UserRole { Admin = 'admin' }

### üü¢ LOW - Cleanup Issues
- [ ] **debug-script.js** - Not in /tmp ‚Üí Move to /tmp/debug-script.js
- [ ] **src/utils.js:78** - console.log(data) ‚Üí Remove debug statement
- [ ] **src/auth.js:45-52** - Commented out old login function ‚Üí DELETE (git has history)
- [ ] **src/api.js:89** - `// const oldEndpoint = '/v1/users'` ‚Üí DELETE
```

CRITICAL: This plan is your CONTRACT. You MUST fix every single item listed.

### PHASE 2: EXECUTE PLAN (for each checkbox item)
1. Update plan to show current item in progress:
   - [‚è≥] **file:line** - Currently fixing...
2. Read the file with the issue
3. Implement the EXACT fix specified in the plan:
   - TODO/FIXME comments: Implement the actual functionality or remove if obsolete
   - NotImplementedException: Write real implementation
   - Assert.Pass(): Replace with meaningful assertions
   - Empty catch blocks: Add proper error handling
   - Debug output/console.log: Remove entirely (tests use runner, production uses logger)
   - Hardcoded values: Move to configuration/environment variables
   - Placeholder code: Replace with real implementation
   - Type 'any': Analyze usage and create ACTUAL type/interface
     * DON'T just rename to UnknownType or AnyType
     * DON'T replace with 'unknown' without fixing
     * DO create real interfaces based on actual usage
   - Missing types: Add explicit type annotations
   - Generic Object: Create specific interface or use existing type
   - Magic numbers: Create named constants (const MAX_RETRIES = 3)
   - Magic strings: Use enums for states/types (enum Status { Active = 'active' })
   - Hardcoded timeouts: Use named constants (const TIMEOUT_MS = 5000)
   - Non-BDD tests: Convert to proper BDD format:
     * Add describe() blocks for components/features
     * Change test() to it('should...')
     * Structure test body as Given-When-Then
     * For SQL: Use tSQLt test classes and naming conventions
   - Bad filenames: Rename to production standards (remove "final", "comprehensive", etc.)
   - "In production..." comments: Remove and implement properly
   - Scripts outside /tmp: Move one-off scripts to /tmp directory
   - TypeScript || operator: Replace with ?? for nullish coalescing
   - Commented out code: DELETE it (don't leave it commented, git preserves history)
   - C++ issues:
     * void* ‚Üí Use templates or proper types
     * (type*) casts ‚Üí Use static_cast<type*>
     * new/delete ‚Üí Use unique_ptr/shared_ptr
     * malloc/free ‚Üí Remove, use RAII
     * #define MAX 100 ‚Üí constexpr int MAX = 100
     * char* str ‚Üí std::string str
     * int arr[10] ‚Üí std::array<int, 10> arr
     * using namespace std in .h ‚Üí Remove from headers

4. After fixing, run targeted verification:
   - Re-scan ONLY the fixed file with auditFake patterns
   - If still has issues, continue fixing
   - If clean, update plan with checkmark:
     - [‚úÖ] **file:line** - FIXED
5. Show updated plan after each fix to track progress

### PHASE 3: VERIFY
After ALL todos completed:
1. Run full /auditFake scan again
2. If any issues found:
   - Add them to todo list
   - Return to PHASE 2
3. If completely clean, proceed to PHASE 4

### PHASE 4: COMMIT
1. Run tests to ensure nothing broke
2. Stage all changes
3. Commit with message: "fix: remove all placeholder code and implement missing functionality"
4. Run /prePush validation

### PHASE 5: REPORT
Generate final report showing:
- Initial issues found: X
- Issues fixed: X
- Files modified: [list]
- Tests status: PASS/FAIL
- Commit SHA: [hash]

## IMPORTANT RULES:
- **PROCESS EVERY SINGLE TODO** - If there are 100 issues, fix all 100
- **DO NOT STOP** after 3, 5, or any number - continue until todo list is EMPTY
- **VERIFY AFTER EACH FIX** - Re-scan the fixed file to confirm it's clean
- NEVER skip an issue because it "seems unimportant" - ALL issues are important
- NEVER leave TODO comments - implement the functionality
- NEVER use placeholder implementations
- NEVER write comments like "in a real production environment..."
- NEVER use filenames like "final-solution.js" or "comprehensive-fix.js"
- ALWAYS put temporary/one-off scripts in /tmp directory
- ALWAYS use production-appropriate naming (userService.js, not user-service-final.js)
- If you don't know how to implement something, research the codebase context
- Continue until ZERO issues remain in the ENTIRE codebase

## BANNED EXCUSE WORDS:
NEVER use these words/phrases to avoid work:
- "core" requirements (ALL requirements matter)
- "key" issues (ALL issues need fixing, not just "key" ones)
- "major" vs "minor" (ALL issues need fixing)
- "primary" concerns (secondary ones matter too)
- "important" patterns (ALL patterns need fixing)
- "significant" problems (insignificant ones need fixing too)
- "critical" issues (non-critical ones also need fixing)
- "main" problems (side problems need fixing too)
- "would require careful attention" (then be careful)
- "refinements" (they're requirements, not optional)
- "primarily" (fix everything, not primarily)
- "successfully cleaned major..." (clean EVERYTHING)

If you write "Let me fix the key ones" ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Fix ALL of them
If you write "There are many, let me handle the important..." ‚Üí STOP ‚Üí Handle ALL

## SELF-MANAGEMENT:
- Use TodoWrite to track EVERY issue (not just first few)
- Work through ALL todos systematically
- Mark each as in_progress when starting, completed when done
- **CONTINUE TO NEXT TODO AUTOMATICALLY** - no pausing
- Don't ask user for guidance - make decisions based on code context
- If blocked, document why in the todo and move to next item
- **COMMIT AFTER EACH VERIFIED FIX** to save progress

## PROOF OF COMPLETION:
Show after EVERY fix:
- ‚úÖ Fixed: [specific issue] in [file]:[line]
- ‚úÖ Verified: File is now clean
- ‚úÖ Committed: Changes saved

Final proof must show:
- ‚úÖ Todos processed: ALL [X/X]
- ‚úÖ Final audit: ZERO issues found
- ‚úÖ All changes committed and pushed

Start the automated fix process immediately and CONTINUE UNTIL DONE.
