Run GoLand analysis and fix all issues:

1. RUN GoLand inspection:
   - Collect all errors
   - Collect all warnings
   - Identify code smells
   - Find duplications

2. CATEGORIZE issues:
   - Compilation errors
   - Type errors
   - Style violations
   - Performance issues
   - Security risks

3. GENERATE fixes:
   - Auto-fix where safe
   - Manual fix recommendations
   - Refactoring suggestions

4. APPLY fixes:
   - Fix errors first
   - Then warnings
   - Finally code smells

5. VERIFY:
   - Re-run analysis
   - Confirm all fixed
   - No new issues introduced

Continue until GoLand reports zero issues.
