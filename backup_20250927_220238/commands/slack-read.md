## Using Context in Development

Before starting work, always:

```bash
# 1. Read recent context
/slack-read

# 2. Check story-specific context
/slack-read PROJ-123

# 3. Check for recent errors
/slack-read errors

# 4. Get summary if needed
/slack-read summary
```

This ensures you:
- Understand current state
- Know about decisions made
- Avoid repeating errors
- Follow team discussions

## Integration with Agents

All agents should:
1. Read Slack context before starting
2. Use context to inform decisions
3. Avoid issues others encountered
4. Follow decisions already made

## Advanced Searches

You can also search for specific terms:

```bash
# Search for specific text
/slack-search "database migration"

# Find mentions of a user
/slack-search "@john"

# Look for specific errors
/slack-search "TypeError"
```

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Always check context before starting work**
‚úÖ **Review recent errors to avoid repeating**
‚úÖ **Follow decisions already made**
‚úÖ **Check who is working on what**

## Troubleshooting

**"No messages found"**
- Check channel name in .env
- Verify bot has channel access
- Ensure bot token is valid

**"Authentication failed"**
- Re-run `/slack-setup`
- Check SLACK_BOT_TOKEN in .env
- Verify app permissions

**"Channel not found"**
- Ensure channel exists
- Bot must be invited to channel
- Check SLACK_CHANNEL in .env
