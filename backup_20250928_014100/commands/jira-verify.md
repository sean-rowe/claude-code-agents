# /jira-verify

SYSTEMATICALLY verifies that EVERY Gherkin feature, rule, and scenario has a corresponding JIRA item. NO SHORTCUTS.

## What It Does

1. **Complete Inventory**: Parses EVERY .feature file
2. **Systematic Check**: Verifies EACH expected item exists
3. **Detailed Reporting**: Creates comprehensive report of findings
4. **No Assumptions**: Checks everything explicitly

## Verification Process

1. Build complete inventory of Gherkin features
2. Get complete inventory from JIRA
3. Compare SYSTEMATICALLY - no fuzzy matching
4. Report EVERY discrepancy
5. Generate detailed markdown report

## What It Verifies

- ‚úÖ Every Feature has a Story
- ‚úÖ Every Scenario has a Subtask
- ‚úÖ Every Rule is in acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Parent-child relationships correct
