description: Demonstrate code works with real execution
allowed-tools: Bash, Read

Prove the implementation is real and working:

1. Run the actual code (not mocked)
2. Show real output from execution
3. Run all tests and show passing results
4. Demonstrate error handling with actual error cases
5. Show database queries executing (if applicable)
6. Display API calls working (if applicable)

Requirements:
- NO mocked output
- NO simulated results
- Show ACTUAL execution
- Include timestamps
- Show full command output

If something doesn't work, fix it and run again.
The goal is to prove beyond doubt that the code is production-ready.
